# Comments: Ran into issues with the margin of my footer, for some reason the div class "bar" would not add margin for my footer but did add margin for the header. I went to two different office hours and could not get the issue figured out. To combat the lack of margin on the footer, I added margin-bottom: 20px; to the "rules" portion of my CSS.
